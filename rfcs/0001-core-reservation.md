# Core Reservation

- Feature Name: core-reservation
- Start Date: 2023-07-27 22:34:00

## Summary
[summary]: #summary

A core reservation service that solves the problem of reservaing a resource for a period of time. We leverage postgres EXCLUDE constrains to ensure that only one reservation can be made for a given resource at a given time.

## Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

We need a common solution for various reservation requirements: 1): calendar booking; 2): hotel/room_booking; 3): meeting room booking; 4): parking lot booking; 5): etc. Repeatedly building features for these requirements is a waste of time and resources. We should have a common solution that can be used by all teams.

## Guide-level explanation

### Service interface

We would use gRPC as a service interface. Below is the proto definition:

```proto3
enum ReservationStatus {
    RESERVATION_STATUS_UNKNOWN = 0;
    RESERVATION_STATUS_PENDING = 1;
    RESERVATION_STATUS_CONFIRMED = 2;
    RESERVATION_STATUS_BLOCKED = 3;
}

enum ReservationUpdateType {
    RESERVATION_UPDATE_TYPE_UNKNOWN = 0;
    RESERVATION_UPDATE_TYPE_CREATE = 1;
    RESERVATION_UPDATE_TYPE_UPDATE = 2;
    RESERVATION_UPDATE_TYPE_DELETE = 3;
}

message Reservation {
    string id = 1;
    string user_id = 2;
    ReservationStatus Status = 3;

    // resource reservation window
    string resource_id = 4;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp start = 5;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp end = 6;

    // extra note
    string note = 7;
}

message ReserveRequest {
    Reservation reservation = 1;
}

message ReserveResponse {
    Reservation reservation = 1;
}

message UpdateRequest {
    string note = 2;
}

message UpdateResponse {
    Reservation reservation = 1;
}

message ConfirmRequest {
    string id = 1;
}

message ConfirmResponse {
    Reservation reservation = 1;
}

message CancelRequest {
    string id = 1;
}

message CancelResponse {
    Reservation reservation = 1;
}

message GetRequest {
    string id = 1;
}

message GetResponse {
    Reservation reservation = 1;
}

message QueryRequest {
    string resource_id = 1;
    string user_id = 2;
    // use status to filter result. if UNKNOWN, then return all reservations
    ReservationStatus status = 3;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp start = 4;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp end = 5;
}

message QueryResponse {
    repeated Reservation reservations = 1;
}

message ListenRequest {}
message ListenResponse {
    int8 op = 1;
    Reservation reservation = 2;
}

service ReservationService {
    rpc reserve(ReserveRequest) returns (ReserveResponse);
    rpc confirm(ConfirmRequest) returns (ConfirmResponse);
    rpc update(UpdateRequest) returns (UpdateResponse);
    rpc cancel(CancelRequest) returns (CancelResponse);
    rpc get(GetRequest) returns (GetResponse);
    rpc query(QueryRequest) returns (stream Reservation);
    // another system could monitor newly added/confirmed/cancelled reservations
    rpc listen(ListenRequest) returns (stream Reservation);
}

// 在Protobuf中,stream可以用来定义流式RPC服务
```

### Database schema

We use postgres as the database. Below is the database schema:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA rsvp
CREATE TYPE rsvp.reservation_status AS ENUM ('unkowne', 'pending', 'confirmed', 'blocked');
CREATE TYPE rsvp.reservation_update_type AS ENUM ('unknown', 'create', 'update', 'delete');
CREATE TABLE rsvp.reservations (
    id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    status rsvp.reservation_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    resource_id VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    timespan TSTZRANGE NOT NULL,

    note TEXT,

    CONSTRAINT reservation_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
    CONSTRAINT reservations_conflict EXCLUDE USING gist (resource_id WITH =, timespan WITH &&)
);

CREATE INDEX reservations_resource_id_idx ON rsvp.reservations (resource_id);
CREATE INDEX reservations_user_id_idx ON rsvp.reservations (user_id);

-- if use_id is null, find all reservations within during for the resource
-- if resource_id is null, find all reservations within during for the user
-- if both user_id and resource_id are null, find all reservations within during
-- if both set, find all reservations within during for the user and resource
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION rsvp.query(uid text, rid text, during: TSTZRANGE) RETURNS TABLE rsvp.reservations AS $$ $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql；

-- reservation change queue
CREATE TABLE rsvp.reservation_changes (
    id SERIAL NOT NULL,,
    reservation_id uuid NOT NULL,
    op rsvp.reservation_update_type NOT NULL
);

-- trigger for add/update/delete a reservation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION rsvp.reservations_trigger() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF TG_OP = 'INSERT' THEN
        -- update reservation_changes
        INSERT INTO rsvp.reservation_changes (reservation_id, op) VALUES (NEW.id, 'create');
    ELSIF TG_OP = 'UPDATE' THEN
        -- if status changed, update reservation_changes
        IF OLD.status != NEW.status THEN
            INSERT INTO rsvp.reservation_changes (reservation_id, op) VALUES (NEW.id, 'update');
        END IF;
    ELSIF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN
        -- update reservation_changes
        INSERT INTO rsvp.reservation_changes (reservation_id, op) VALUES (OLD.id, 'delete');
    END IF;
    -- notify a channel called reservation_update
    NOTIFY reservation_update;
    RETURN NULL;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER reservations_trigger AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON rsvp.reservations FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE rsvp.reservations_trigger();
```

Here we use EXCLUDE constraint provided by postgre to ensure that on overlapping reservations cannot be made for a given resource at a given time.
``` sql
CONSTRAINT reservations_conflict EXCLUDE USING gist (resource_id WITH =, timespan WITH &&)
```

![overlapping](./images/overlapping.png)

We also use a trigger to notify a channel when a reservation is added/updated/deleted. to make sure even we missed certain messages from the channel when DB connection is down for some reason, we use a queue to store reservation changes. Thus when we receive a  notification, we can query the queue to get all the changes since last time we checed, and once we finished processing all the changes, we can delete them from the queue.

### Core flow

![core flow](images/core_flow.png)

[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the language and you were teaching it to another Rust programmer. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how Rust programmers should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use Rust. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing Rust programmers and new Rust programmers.
- Discuss how this impacts the ability to read, understand, and maintain Rust code. Code is read and modified far more often than written; will the proposed feature make code easier to maintain?

For implementation-oriented RFCs (e.g. for compiler internals), this section should focus on how compiler contributors should think about the change, and give examples of its concrete impact. For policy RFCs, this section should provide an example-driven introduction to the policy, and explain its impact in concrete terms.

## Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

## Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?
- If this is a language proposal, could this be done in a library or macro instead? Does the proposed change make Rust code easier or harder to read, understand, and maintain?

## Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- For language, library, cargo, tools, and compiler proposals: Does this feature exist in other programming languages and what experience have their community had?
- For community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other languages, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other languages.

Note that while precedent set by other languages is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an RFC.
Please also take into consideration that rust sometimes intentionally diverges from common language features.

## Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- how to handle repeated reservation? - is this more less a business logic which shouldn't be put into this layer?(no-goal: we consdie this as a business logic and should be handled by the caller)
- if load is big, we may use an extract queue for recording canges.
- we have't considered tracking/observability/deployment yet.
- query performance might be an issue - need to revisit the index and also consider using cache.
## Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would
be and how it would affect the language and project as a whole in a holistic
way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible
interactions with the project and language in your proposal.
Also consider how this all fits into the roadmap for the project
and of the relevant sub-team.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section
is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be
in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs.
The section merely provides additional information.
